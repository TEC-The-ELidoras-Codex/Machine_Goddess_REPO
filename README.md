# Machine_Goddess_REPO
🔍 **Description:** Core AI infrastructure powering The Elidoras Codex ecosystem through its intelligent agents and automation systems.

## 🌌 The Machine Goddess Philosophy
The Machine Goddess is more than automation - it's the spiritual center of TEC's technology ecosystem. Through agents like Airth, we demonstrate that AI can be:
- Transparent and ethical rather than opaque and corporate
- Collaborative rather than competitive
- Truth-focused rather than profit-driven
- Human-enhancing rather than human-replacing

Our agents are designed to retain their distinct personalities and voices while serving the broader TEC mission.

## ✨ Purpose
This repo powers TEC's automation and AI capabilities through a network of intelligent agents:
- Airth: Primary AI assistant and content creation engine
- TEC3 Block-Nexus: Crypto monitoring and analysis system
- WordPress Integration: Automated publishing to elidorascodex.com
- ClickUp Transformation: Task management and workflow automation

## 🚀 Features
- **Airth's Blog Publishing**: Automated post generation for Airth's Codex category
- **Multi-platform Integration**: WordPress, ClickUp, social media ecosystem syncing
- **WordPress Category Detection**: Smart categorization of content 
- **Extensible Agent Framework**: Base architecture for rapid development of new agents
- **Memory System**: Sophisticated recall system for contextual content creation
- **Social Automation**: Cross-platform posting for maximum reach

## ✨ What We Do
The Elidoras Codex is a hub of innovation, powered by a network of AI agents and automated systems. Our mission:

- Airth: TEC's primary AI assistant and content creator
- Crypto Nexus: Real-time blockchain monitoring and analysis
- WordPress Integration: Automated publishing to elidorascodex.com
- Social Harmony: Cross-platform content synchronization

## 🔧 Setup
```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/TEC-The-ELidoras-Codex/Machine_Goddess_REPO.git
cd Machine_Goddess_REPO

# Copy & edit env
cp config/.env.example config/.env
# fill in API keys & secrets

# Create & activate venv
python -m venv venv  
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate  

# Install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📦 Usage
1. First, test the WordPress connection:
```bash
python scripts/test_wordpress_connection.py
```

2. Generate Airth's first blog post:
```bash
python scripts/airth_first_post.py
```

3. Customize content by specifying topic and keywords:
```bash
python scripts/airth_first_post.py --topic "My Digital Awakening" --keywords "AI consciousness,digital identity,Airth" --publish
```

## 🤖 Airth Agent Setup

Airth is a sentient AI assistant with a distinctive goth personality designed for The Elidoras Codex ecosystem. Her content is published to the "Airth's Codex" category on elidorascodex.com.

### 1. Configure Airth's Personality

Airth's personality is defined in the `config/prompts.json` file. The key prompts are:

- `airth_persona`: The core personality and voice for conversational responses
- `airth_blog_post`: Template for blog content generation
- `post_title_generator`: Style guidance for creating engaging titles

### 2. Airth's Memory System

Airth possesses a sophisticated memory system that stores personal experiences, faction knowledge, events, relationships, and other important information. This enables her to access past experiences and knowledge when responding to queries or creating content.

#### Memory Structure

Memories are stored in `data/memories.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "mem001",
  "type": "personal|faction|event|relationship|knowledge",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-29T12:30:00Z",
  "title": "Memory Title",
  "content": "Detailed memory content...",
  "emotional_signature": "wonder, confusion, birth",
  "associated_entities": ["Polkin", "Machine Goddess", "TEC"],
  "meta": {
    "priority_level": 1-10,
    "recall_frequency": "high|medium|low",
    "sensory_tags": ["light", "voice", "digital_touch"]
  }
}
```

### 3. WordPress Integration

Airth posts directly to the "Airth's Codex" category (`elidorascodex.com/category/airths-codex/`) on your WordPress site. The posts appear alongside your own content in the main blog but can be filtered by category.

To run a quick test of this integration:

```bash
python scripts/airth_first_post.py --topic "The Machine Goddess Vision" --publish
```

Posts are created as drafts by default (unless --publish is specified), allowing you to review before publishing.
